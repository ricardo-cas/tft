Three ways to play
 
if you don't have morello by stage 4 just ff the game and go next (GA super good for playing flex)
 
NEVER TAKE ANYTHING TO DO W/ IMPERIAL, NEVER GO INTO 3-2 AND BE LIKE BET TIME TO PLAY JHIN
 
TIER 1 AUGMENTS 
SSSSSS : Stand United I
SSSS   : Ascension
SS     : Bodyguard heart, duet
A: Just don't be an idiot, its pretty obvious
 
Tier 2 Augments
SSSSS : Metabolic, Share the spotlight
SSS   : Cybernetic, Stand
Underated : Celestial 2
 
Tier 3 Augments
ALL STREAK AUGMENTS ARE GOOD, 
 
 
8 on 4-2
-most of the time yordle early or lose streak early --> 8 on 4-2 w/ 30 gold, roll until stable
-if played correctly, you don't actually have to replace all your units, just rolling for a few upgrades
common boards....
ad = yordle bodyguard trist
ap = yordle bodyguard malz
DON'T BE SCARED TO BE SUB 50 @ 3-2, you're chilling trust
pacing : 40 gold w/ yordle in @ 3-2 level 6
 
 
8 on 4-5
-dropped yordles mid game or didn't play yordles at all,
-streaked early but lost streak to some turbo highroller
-don't be scared to roll slightly on 7 but do not commit
-if not on pace to 4-2, can roll to 10/20 if its good to roll 
pacing : not above pacing
 
honestly probably never winning unless no one highrolled 4-2
 
8 on 5-1
you played incorrectly and you suck or reroll malz
 
 
Sub 4-1 boards
-Upgraded brawlers + Cait MF or Malz
-Upgraded bodyguard + yordles + MF/trist / Malz/4 Arc
-Creative augment boards
i.e. sin augment w/ random early kat 2 
 
Post 4-2 boards
Fiora + Kaisa + Upgrades
Urgot + Kog + Mundo + Kaisa + Upgrades
Socialite(1/2) + fiora
Upgraded utility + Malz 2
Upgraded utility + MF 2
Socialite + Tahm Kench (basically instant win if u had gold to upgrade supporting units as well)
JUST GO FOR UPGRADES, if u hit yone 2, just slam ur GA + Ad items on him and play around him
hit orianna, maybe play camille for a bit, hit fiora 1, yone 2, items on yone, play vi and random upgraded bruiser
 
META IS TO JUST SAVE AS MUCH HP AS POSSIBLE UNTIL YOU CAN FIND A KAISA AND MOVE MORELLO TO KAISA
 
Don't worry about mutant too much for kaisa when you are playing body guard frontline b/c pivoting into mundo kench from body guards feels troll
 
Mutant that kaisa really wants 
Meta + Bioleeching 
Voracious is good w/ phony frontline / fon / a lot of units
 
Stand united --> cap board around yuumi leona braum jayce fiora kaisa just need to slowly get there but its hella easy, just play infinite synergies, ur up a prismatic
 
AP Flex BIS = Morello for kaisa,
if you hit kaisa 1 but fiora 2 and u have 0 gold, just put the GA on fiora and use kaisa as a morello bot
 
AD Flex BIS = GA + 2, doesn't matter, combat augment prayge (cybernetic, knifes edge, ascension, stand)
 
 
Rod = first or eighth, almost always lose streaking into a 4-2
Bow = if ur full tryharding and basically want to guarantee top 5, its bow
Chain = kind of like bow, its ok
Belt = probabaly worse
Glove = first or eighth ad variant, can't tell, prob better than belt
Cloak = lol
Tear = not bad not sure
Sword = its ok
 
Bow > Chain > Rod > Sword = Glove = Belt > Tear > Cloak
 
I never start rod so idk, also tear always works out for me but idk if im highrolling
 
Bow --> Titans --> fiora
GS flex
LW flex
Runaans flex
Random RFC if ur commited AP
shiv --> urgot / early streak / malz / kaisa
 
Chain -- > Bramble, ga, titans
Belt --> warmogs but u need morello first
Rod --> morello guaranteed
Glove --> Shroud for late game cap
Cloak --> lmaooooo, if u get another claok just ff
tear --> Shiv early, blue for stand united jayce, FH but u usually want a GA first
Sword --> GA/GS/DB prob not as good as bow on ezreal / brawlers board so definitely worse than bow
 
don't bother making IE half the time unless u have LW or u know ur playing JG / IE Fiora and somehow know you're just gonna hit fiora
 
HOJ is w/e of an item but if ur streaking, u can slam on ezreal 2 or smth, --> 4-5 w/ 60ish HP , get ur top 4 and get out
 
slamming items --> streak stage 2 --> lose a few rounds but not 10-0'd stage 3 --> 4-5 w/ 60 hp --> roll until stable, hold transitions --> guaranteed top 5
--> next game
 
slamming items --> streak stage 3 --> highroll augments --> fast 9 --> first
 
don't slam items --> 4-2 properly don't just spam d without buying anything --> can go 7th but average placement around the same
 
don't be scared to just take ur top 5 guaranteed and move on
over 100 games, if ur in that guaranteed top 5 spot, ur + infinite LP
